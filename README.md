## API

### API Notes
- Pageview API has the ability to filter out views from spiders/crawlers, while the Legacy Pagecounts API does not have such abilities. 
- There was about 1 year of overlapping traffic data between the two APIs, and data from both APIs in the 1 year of overlapping period is included.
- API calls are modeled after this [Jupyter Notebook](https://public.paws.wmcloud.org/User:Jtmorgan/data512_a1_example.ipynb).
